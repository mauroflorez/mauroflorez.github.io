    "text": "Count data play a crucial role in sports analytics, providing valuable insights into various aspects of the game. Models that accurately capture the characteristics of count data are essential for making reliable inferences. In this paper, we propose the use of the Conway–Maxwell–Poisson (CMP) model for analyzing count data in sports. The CMP model offers flexibility in modeling data with different levels of dispersion. Here we consider a bivariate CMP model that models the potential correlation between home and away scores by incorporating a random effect specification. We illustrate the advantages of the CMP model through simulations. We then analyze data from baseball and soccer games before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The performance of our proposed CMP model matches or outperforms standard Poisson and Negative Binomial models, providing a good fit and an accurate estimation of the observed effects in count data with any level of dispersion. The results highlight the robustness and flexibility of the CMP model in analyzing count data in sports, making it a suitable default choice for modeling a diverse range of count data types in sports, where the data dispersion may vary.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background: Many microRNAs have been identified as critical mediators in the progression of melanoma through its regulation of genes involved in different cellular processes such as melanogenesis, cell cycle control, and senescence. However, microRNAs’ concurrent participation in syngeneic mouse B16F1 melanoma cells simultaneously induced decreased proliferation and differential pigmentation by exposure to 5-Brd-2′-dU (5’Bromo-2-deoxyuridine) and L-Tyr (L-Tyrosine) respectively, is poorly understood.\nAim: To evaluate changes in the expression of microRNAs and identify which miRNAs in-network may contribute to the functional bases of phenotypes of differential pigmentation and reduction of proliferation in B16F1 melanoma cells exposed to 5-Brd-2′-dU and L-Tyr. Methods: Small RNAseq evaluation of the expression profiles of miRNAs in B16F1 melanoma cells exposed to 5-Brd-2′-dU (2.5 μg/mL) and L-Tyr (5 mM), as well as the expression by qRT-PCR of some molecular targets related to melanogenesis, cell cycle, and senescence. By bioinformatic analysis, we constructed network models of regulation and co-expression of microRNAs.\nResults: We confirmed that stimulation or repression of melanogenesis with L-Tyr or 5-Brd-2′-dU, respectively, generated changes in melanin concentration, reduction in proliferation, and changes in expression of microRNAs 470-3p, 470-5p, 30d-5p, 129-5p, 148b-3p, 27b-3p, and 211-5p, which presented patterns of coordinated and reciprocal co-expression, related to changes in melanogenesis through their putative targets Mitf, Tyr and Tyrp1, and control of cell cycle and senescence: Cyclin D1, Cdk2, Cdk4, p21, and p27. Conclusions: These findings provide insights into the molecular biology of melanoma of the way miRNAs are coordinated and reciprocal expression that may operate in a network as molecular bases for understanding changes in pigmentation and decreased proliferation induced in B16F1 melanoma cells exposed to L-Tyr and 5-Brd-2′-dU.\nMy main contribution to this project was on detecting the differentially expressed miRNAs, we evaluate the differential expression using the negative binomial distribution and the shrinkage estimator for the distribution of the variance. We normalized the data by calculating each factor’s weight using a function that calculates its weight. With the normalized data, we proceeded to calculate the miRNAs differentially expressed using the DESeq2. For more details check Section 4.12.\n\nRivera, H. M., Muñoz, E.

However, Colombia won its game 1-0, so the final will be Argentina vs. Colombia, while the 3rd and 4th place game will be played between Canada and Uruguay.\nThe final is anticipated to be a close match, with the most likely result being 0-0, as indicated below. However, Argentina is expected to have a slightly higher probability of scoring more goals than Colombia.\n\nresults_game &lt;- tibble(\"Argentina\" = predictions[,7], \"Colombia\" = predictions[,8])\n\ndf_count &lt;- results_game %&gt;% \n  group_by(Argentina, Colombia) %&gt;% \n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = \"keep\") %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\ntotal_combinations &lt;- nrow(results_game)\n\ndf_count &lt;- df_count %&gt;% \n    mutate(proportion = count/total_combinations)\n  \nggplot(df_count, aes(x = Argentina, y = Colombia, fill = proportion)) +\n  geom_tile() + \n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"white\", high = \"blue\") + \n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Goals Scored by the two teams\",\n       x = \"Argentina\", \n       y = \"Colombia\",\n       fill = \"Probability\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we saw, the model accurately predicted the scores and captured the strengths of each team. It also produced reasonable and accurate results for the final games based on the quarter-final outcomes. Spain defeated England 2-1, while the match between Argentina and Colombia ended 0-0, with Argentina scoring a goal in extra time.\nFor future models, incorporating dynamic strengths could improve accuracy."

    "text": "Background: Epidemiological and clinical evidence points cancer comorbidity with pulmonary chronic disease. The acquisition of some hallmarks of cancer by cells affected with lung pathologies as a cell adaptive mechanism to a shear stress, suggests that could be associated with the establishment of tumoral processes.\nObjective: To propose a bioinformatic pipeline for the identification of all deregulated genes and the transcriptional regulators (TFs) that are coexpressed during lung cancer establishment, and therefore could be important for the acquisition of the hallmarks of cancer.\nMethods: Ten microarray datasets (six of lung cancer, four of lung diseases) comparing normal and diseases-related lung tissue were selected to identify hub differentiated expressed genes (DEGs) in common between lung pathologies and lung cancer, along with transcriptional regulators through the utilization of specialized libraries from R language. DAVID bioinformatics tool for gene enrichment analyses was used to identify genes with experimental evidence associated to tumoral processes and signaling pathways. Coexpression networks of DEGs and TFs in lung cancer establishment were created with Coexnet library, and a survival analysis of the main hub genes was made.\nResults: Two hundred ten DEGs were identified in common between lung cancer and other lung diseases related to the acquisition of tumoral characteristics, which are coexpressed in a lung cancer network with TFs, suggesting that could be related to the establishment of the tumoral pathology in lung. The comparison of the coexpression networks of lung cancer and other lung diseases allowed the identification of common connectivity patterns (CCPs) with DEGs and TFs correlated to important tumoral processes and signaling pathways, that haven´t been studied to experimentally validate their role in the early stages of lung cancer. Some of the TFs identified showed a correlation between its expression levels and the survival of lung cancer patients.\nConclusion: Our findings indicate that lung diseases share genes with lung cancer which are coexpressed in lung cancer, and might be able to explain the epidemiological observations that point to direct and inverse comorbid associations between some chronic lung diseases and lung cancer and represent a complex transcriptomic scenario.\n\nOtálora-Otálora, B.
