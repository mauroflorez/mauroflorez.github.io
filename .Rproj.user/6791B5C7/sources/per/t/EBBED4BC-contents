## About me

I am a PhD Candidate in Statistics at Rice University. My research focuses on developing Bayesian models for multivariate data, working under the direction of Dr. [Marina Vannucci](https://marina.blogs.rice.edu/). I am passionate about formulating innovative statistical methods to analyze different types of data, with a diverse range of applications, from healthcare to sports.

When I am not immersed in data and research, I love soccer –watching or playing– as well as exploring new places and taking pictures. Check out some of my travel photos [here](https://mauroflorez.github.io/gallery.html).
