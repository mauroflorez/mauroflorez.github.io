## MultRegCMP

[MultRegCMP](https://mauroflorez.github.io/MultRegCMP/) is an R package that I designed to fit a Bayesian Multivariate regression model for count data. This model have been used to analyze football and baseball scores. A practical example on how to use it can be found in this [Football Vignette](https://mauroflorez.github.io/MultRegCMP/articles/Example-Real-Data.html).
