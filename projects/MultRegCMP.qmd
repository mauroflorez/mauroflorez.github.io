## MultRegCMP

[MultRegCMP](https://mauroflorez.github.io/CMP/) is an R package designed to fit a Bayesian Multivariate regression model for count data. This model have been used to analyze football and baseball scores (See this [Paper](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jqas-2024-0072/html)). A practical example on how to use it can be found in this [Football Vignette](https://mauroflorez.github.io/CMP/articles/Example-Real-Data.html).
