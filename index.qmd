## About me

I’m a Data Scientist and Ph.D. graduate in Statistics from **Rice University** under the direction of Dr. [Marina Vannucci](https://marina.blogs.rice.edu/). My work focuses on Bayesian modeling for multivariate and count data, with applications in healthcare, sports, and social science. I’m currently interning at **Amazon**, developing deep learning models to analyze community sentiment from diverse data sources.

When I am not immersed in data and research, I love soccer –watching or playing– as well as exploring new places and taking pictures. Check out some of my travel photos [here](https://mauroflorez.github.io/gallery.html).

My latest projects involve developing frameworks for estimating graphical models that identify relationships or dependencies between different mixed data types.

## Education

![](media/logos2.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

I completed my undergraduate studies in Bogotá, Colombia, earning a BS in Mathematics from Universidad Sergio Arboleda with a tuition waiver scholarship. I also hold a BS in Statistics from Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where I graduated first in my class. I recently completed a PhD in Statistics at Rice University, where my research focused on Bayesian modeling for complex multivariate and count data.
